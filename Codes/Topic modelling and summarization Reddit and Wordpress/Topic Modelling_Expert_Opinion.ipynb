insurance. According to Pauly, those who signed up for coverage for this year may well be the core portion of the population that finds getting their health insurance through the exchanges a good deal because the great bulk of them get subsidies.\n","\n","Heavy federal subsidies are designed to offset premium increases by insurers in the health care marketplace, or the health exchanges that individual states operate.\n","That means theres more money being generated in that industry than ever before. He noted that during the recent recession, health care was the bright spot in terms of hiring. Added Field: Health care in this country is a giant jobs program, and its immune to recessions.\n","\n","ADDITIONAL READING\n","PUBLIC POLICY\n","What Changes Are Ahead for the Affordable Care Act?\n","In this sense, the delivery of health care is similar to that found in the United States where, for the most part, large numbers of employee groups, independent insurers, and providers reach agreements without direct government intervention.\n","[64]\n"," \n","\n","Common Methods to Lower Health Care Costs\n","\n","By taking an international perspective and looking to other advanced industrialized countries with nearly full coverage, much can be learned.\n","Unless the price of medical services decreases  perhaps to what it actually costs the provider to provide the service  its unlikely that the average American will ever be able to use health insurance in the same manner as car or home insurance.\n","But the biggest failure with these proposals is that they fail to address the underlying problem with the American health care system: We are spending far too much, and getting far too little in return, for our health care dollar.\n","[29]\n","Smaller firms are significantly less likely to provide health benefits to full or part-time workers.\n","As soon as the drug enters the market, a new process of benefit assessment begins. Manufacturers must establish, through comparative effective research that the new drug has an added benefit to the patient, compared to the previously existing standard treatment. Drugs without added benefit will be reimbursed according to a government pricing list.\n","Nigeria\n","While Nigeria has a public health service financed through a national insurance scheme, newcomers to the country might want to consider their own private medical insurance, use private health care facilities, and make sure they are covered for repatriation (in the event of death) or medical evacuation to another better-equipped country, if necessary.\n","You would be guaranteed that youd have every provider in the network, but Medicare would then make decisions not just about payment, but also about coverage and new technologies.\n","\n","A single-payer system would doubtless be disruptive to the private health insurance industry, but opinions were mixed on how serious that could be.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
