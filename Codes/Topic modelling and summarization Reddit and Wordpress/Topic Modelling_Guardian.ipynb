child mortality\n"," Read more\n","“We’ve seen a number of countries where, when you take away user fees too quickly, you overload the system,” said Lejeune, adding that any health ministry reforms needed the full support of the presidency, which this government had.\n","I’m not making that up: huge swathes of the population never used the services because they just couldn’t afford them.”\n","\n","Charlotte Lejeune, Mali country director for the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which has been supporting the health ministry’s reforms, said the success over the next four years would depend on how progressively the government rolled out the changes.\n","Gershlick says a 4% budget hike would enable the NHS to improve the number of mental health patients getting treatment from four in 10 to seven in 10, boost capital spending, reduce waiting times and, crucially, do more in the field of prevention to stop people needing the NHS in the first place.\n","“It’s a good time for collective recognition for the failing of these policies, and for us to admit collectively that we were wrong and to help other countries where user fees are still rife, for example [the Democratic Republic of the] Congo and Nigeria, where pregnant women are still charged very high user fees for their services and where thousands of people are locked up because they can’t afford their healthcare fees,” said Yates.\n","According to a 2011 study in the Lancet medical journal, 39 million Indians are pushed into poverty every year due to medical costs, a fact that possibly explains why even Britain’s imperfect and overburdened NHS seems like a dream to many here.\n","Do remember, though, that NHS funding could be increased by 50% and UK government spending from health would still only just be hitting US levels – this is not a system that is intrinsically broken, just one that’s underfunded.\n","Only three months after the foundation of the NHS, its architect, Nye Bevan, said: “I have been exhorting the general public in the last few weeks to make use of this National Health Service prudently, intelligently and morally, because if too great a strain is placed upon it at the beginning it might break down, and because things are free is no reason why people should abuse their opportunity.”\n","\n","Seventy years later, his words are prophetic indeed.\n","One country that has grasped the importance of aged care is Japan, which in 2000 saw the threat that elderly needs posed to its health system and took action.\n","The catch-22 is that improving people’s health generally prolongs their lives, putting more pressure on the NHS – it costs five times more to look after an 80-year-old than a 30-year-old.\n","“The ministry of health has taken a very brave and bold political move to make real, evidence-based healthcare change.”\n","\n","Mali’s child mortality rate is among the highest in the world, estimated at 106 deaths for every 1,000 births, according to the most recent figures available.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
