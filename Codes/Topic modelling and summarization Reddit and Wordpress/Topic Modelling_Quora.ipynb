health insurance and medical system is possibly the single greatest argument against the notion of “the freer the market, the freer the people”.The actual care may be excellent — but you need to be willing to be metaphorically bent over the nearest hard surface and given a good rogering by insurance companies before you can get access to it.And God help you if you have terrible insurance — because it means that you'll put off going to the doctor until your condition is significantly worse and harder to treat….and also more expensive.\n","And guess what I of course had to go with the
